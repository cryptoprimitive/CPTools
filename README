# CryptoPrimitive Tools

A Python script that currently only connects to the slutty CP server and shows the titles of all 'BPCreated' events.

This should serve as a good core for any other Python CryptoPrimitive contract interface.

To actually send eth/gas and interact with the contracts (i.e. create or commit to a BP), you'll need a personal account (see web3py docs). The only issue is that the server, as I said, is the slutty one. 

... Don't put a lot of money on it. I have it in mainnet because developing on Ropsten is for pussies.

We are using the beta branch of Web3py as well as the [current version](https://github.com/cryptoprimitive/contracts/blob/master/BurnablePayment.sol) of the BP contract (Burnable Service upgrade).
