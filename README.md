# CryptoPrimitive Tools

## Setup

Install required pip modules:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

While many of these Python scripts can be used on their own (utils, easy_web3_connection), this project is mainly aimed at supporting a single script, agents.py. We may add other user-facing scripts in the future.

## agents.py

Agents is designed as a quick wallet-like utility for common Ethereum operations
